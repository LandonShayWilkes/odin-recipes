<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lemon chicken is really just a simple baked chicken recipe, jazzed up with some punchy ingredients that add lots of flavor without taking away from how super-healthy baked chicken breasts are. Our lemon chicken recipe is fast and easy—a recipe you might turn to on a busy weeknight when you need dinner to be simple as it can be. It’s also a great one to include in your weekend meal-prep (if you do that kind of thing) because one of the many reasons we love lemon chicken breasts is their versatility.</p>
<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Dried oregano | thyme | garlic powder | salt | black pepper</li>
    <li>Dry white wine</li>
    <li>Minced garlic</li>
    <li>Lemon zest</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
    <li>lemon</li>
    <li>Minced parsley</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<Ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the center position.</li>
    <li>Pat the chicken dry and place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper. Coat the chicken all over with the mixture.</li>
    <li>In the same bowl, mix together the wine, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, brown sugar, and remaining ½ teaspoon of the salt. Pour the sauce over chicken and nestle the lemon slices in between the breasts if using.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the dish from the oven and baste the chicken with the juices. Return the dish to the oven and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer.</li>
    <li>Serve chicken family-style, sprinkled with parsley, if using.</li>
